# KitBuild

## Way I Made KitBuild

I made KitBuild __in the C programming language__.  
I made KitBuild to be a replacement for GNU Make.

## What KitBuild Is

KitBuild is one of my projects written in the __C programming language__.  
It is a prototype build system that will eventually use a YAML-inspired syntax for defining targets, dependencies, and commands.

## Developer Moments

- The first time I ran the build, GCC completely refused to compile it 😂.  
- Two headers defined the same token size — it was a full-blown “Header World War 2”!  
- I fixed it by creating a single `type.h` file to unify the definitions.  
- It only took maybe less than a minute to apply the `type.h` fix.
